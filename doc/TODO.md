# TODO

* Go through a list of memory-cards. Go to next after each card is flipped.
  * Send in list into a MemoryCardRotaterComponent (should this handle both modes?)
  * Goes to next when clicked after the card has been flipped.
  * Shows "Done!" when gone through all cards.
  * Write a test for this.
* Add second mode, where you first see the description, and type in the term.
